        <h2>Day 1-3: Learning Checkov for AWS CDK Scanning</h2>
        <p>The first three days were focused on setting up the development environment and diving into Checkov, a powerful tool for scanning Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Here are the key takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Successfully set up Node.js, npm, AWS CDK, and Checkov</li>
            <li>Created a new GitHub repository: <a href='https://github.com/atulgoel126/devsecops-ts-cdk-security'>"devsecops-ts-cdk-security"</a></li>
            <li>Completed the AWS CDK TypeScript Workshop, gaining hands-on experience with CDK</li>
            <li>Studied Checkov documentation, understanding its capabilities and integration with AWS CDK</li>
            <li>Created a basic AWS CDK project with an S3 bucket and EC2 instance, then ran Checkov to identify security issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Day 4-5: Implementing Security Best Practices in AWS CDK</h2>
        <p>The next two days were dedicated to implementing security best practices in AWS CDK using TypeScript. Here's what I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Studied AWS CDK Best Practices documentation</li>
            <li>Implemented secure patterns for S3 buckets, including encryption and access logging</li>
            <li>Created least privilege IAM roles for EC2 instances</li>
            <li>Configured VPC settings for enhanced network security</li>
            <li>Explored CDK Aspects to apply security policies across the entire stack</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Day 6-7: Mini-project: Securing an AWS CDK TypeScript Template</h2>
        <p>The week concluded with a mini-project to apply all the learned concepts. Here's what I accomplished:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forked the AWS CDK TypeScript Examples repository</li>
            <li>Selected a serverless application example with API Gateway and Lambda</li>
            <li>Ran Checkov against the chosen example and documented all security issues</li>
            <li>Created a new branch to address each security concern using TypeScript</li>
            <li>Implemented a custom CDK construct for a secure S3 bucket</li>
            <li>Re-ran Checkov to verify improvements and created a pull request with detailed explanations</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

        <h2>Reflections and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>This week has been an eye-opening experience in the world of Infrastructure as Code security. I've gained valuable insights into how to build secure cloud infrastructure using AWS CDK and TypeScript. Moving forward, I plan to explore more advanced topics and integrate these practices into larger projects.</p>
